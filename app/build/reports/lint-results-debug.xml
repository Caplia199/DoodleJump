        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background.
